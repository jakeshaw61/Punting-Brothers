# The Punting Brothers
![Image](/assets/screenshots/responsive.png?raw=true)
The Punting Brothers website is aimed at those who are looking to go punting for the first time or those who have been punting before but would like to try a different service. The site also offers a brief history of the punts and Cambridge which helps cater to those who have no previous knowledge of punting.

## Design 
I wanted a minimalist overall design with interesting images on each page and a simple colour scheme that links  throughout.

### Colour Scheme
![Image](/assets/screenshots/colour-scheme.png?raw=true)  
I have chosen one feature colour throughout the site which blends the pages together. I chose this colour to be the feature as it similar to the Cambridge Blue, which is associated to the city and university.  This colour is used for the header, form section and for the buttons with a darker shade for the hover over.  I choose a medium grey colour to clearly define the footer which stands out against the off-white background.

### Typography
I used 2 google fonts for the site which are Oswald and Montserrat. For the logo and headings, I chose Oswald as I wanted a strong, bolder font to make each section of the page clear. I then used Montserrat for the majority of the text on the site. These two fonts are used throughout the site to maintain consistency. I choose Sans Serif as a fallback font. 

### Images 
- Home Page - The Homepage includes a hero image of a bright, colourful scene of the River Cam with lots of people punting, which stands out against the off-white background. I chose this image as it is a good introduction to the page and what it offers. Further down the home page there are 3 images representing each service that is on offer.

- Services Page - The services page includes an image for each service that is on offer, which are different from the ones seen on the homepage. I chose images that are related to each service to help the user understand more about the services being featured.

- Gallery Page - I chose to add a gallery page to showcase lots of images of punting and Cambridge to help deliver more information to the user about the service without taking up more spaces on the other pages. 

## Wireframes 
I used Balsamiq to make some wireframes of how I wanted the site to look. Making the wireframes was very useful as I was able to imagine what the pages and features would look like on different size screens.

It includes links to the Logo, About section, History section, Services page and the Gallery page. The navigation bar is fully responsive and the view of the navigation bar is the same across all screen sizes so it will feel familiar to users. This allows users to easily navigate between pages without having to use the back button.

### The Landing Image

### Responsive 
I used a mobile first approach when designing the site, starting off at the smallest screen size of 320px and scaling it up to screen sizes larger than 1200px. I used Flex-Box and Grid throughout the site, so when i came to the media queries i only had to make some simple changes like flex-direction or column count to make it responsive for other screen sizes. 

### Bugs
