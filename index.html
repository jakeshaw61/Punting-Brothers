            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>The Punting Brothers began in 1990 by two friends whilst at university in the city. 
                Both having summer jobs working on the river, we were given the opportunity to take over a small punting company. 
                After 30 years we have grown into a well-established company whose name is trusted with locals and tourist to give a first class and friendly service.

                Our Tours are a fun and relaxed way to see the sights, youâ€™ll hear all the history and stories of Cambridge from our tour guides whilst being expertly punted along the River Cam. 
                Or try punting yourself with one of our Self-Hire boats to experience the river in a thrilling new way.
