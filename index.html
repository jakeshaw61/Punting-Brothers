            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>The Punting Brothers began in 1990 by two friends whilst at university in the city. 
                Both having summer jobs working on the river, we were given the opportunity to take over a small punting company. 
                After 30 years we have grown the comapny into a well-established name, which is trusted with locals and tourist to give a first class service.
                Our Tours are a fun and relaxed way to see the sights, you’ll hear all the history and stories of Cambridge from our tour guides whilst being expertly punted along the River Cam. 
                Or try punting yourself with one of our Self-Hire boats to experience the river in a thrilling new way.

                <h2>History of Punting</h2>
                <p>Punts are flat bottomed boats which were developed in medieval times, originally as cargo boats. 
                    The design of the boat meant they could be used in areas of shallow water where conventual boats couldn’t go.
                    In the late 19th century, the use of punts become popular for recreational use, 
                    pleasure punts were then introduced in Cambridge in the early 1900’s for the public to enjoy.
                    Over the years punting has grown to be a hugely popular attraction, 
                    with locals and tourists visiting Cambridge all year round, to enjoy the sights and history of Cambridge from a unique experience of punting.
